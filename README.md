IBM Technical Challenge Solution
The Challenge
During your internship you will likely be contributing code to ongoing research projects and
we want to see your coding ability and approach to solving problems.
The public transportation demand prediction dataset comprises information about tickets
purchased from Mobiticket for 14 routes from “up country” into Nairobi for 7 months. You’ll
need a Zindi account to access the data and you can read more about the dataset from the
challenge page. Your task is not to participate in the Zindi challenge but answer a series of
questions below using the data from (train_revised.csv) file.
1. Find the top 7 most travelled routes for a Sunday on average, indicate the average of
each and rank them in decreasing order
2. What is the probability that a passenger travelling from Kijauri will take a Shuttle if
they depart before 07:30?
3. The Sequence ‘MK’ appears in a payment reference. Based on the distribution of
characters in all the payment references what do you think is the most probable next
character (if any)?
Please submit all of your code, as well as a summary of your thought process for the steps
you took and tools you chose to use. Feel free to use whatever programming language you
think is most appropriate to answer the question(s). What we’re interested in is your
thought process, so if you deliberated between multiple languages or tools, please share
with us why you picked the ones you did. In addition to submitting your code, feel free to
submit materials in whatever format you feel best communicates your reasoning. Please
submit by email to &lt;&gt;
We expect that you should be able to complete the process in a few hours. Feel free to
reach out to us with any questions!
